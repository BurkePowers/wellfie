## Project Information

The current design of WELLFIE consists of a web-based user interface, used to collect user responses to personal financial information, social media handles and quiz answers. The social media accounts are then parsed and analyzed via an AI neural net processor, which has been trained on Kaggle data to map the userâ€™s personality to one of the 16 MBTI traits. These traits are mapped to FTR levels based on research included in the appendix to this document. 

The main processing engine analyzes the responses to the user inputs to map them on 2 dimensions - FTR and Financial knowledge. The processor engine combines the social media personality trait with self-reported attitudes to life to make a single prediction of the risk level in a financial context. Performance on the quiz is taken as a proxy for financial knowledge.

Once the user is defined on these two levels, the engine then makes a prediction of the risk and investment profile and suggests possible asset allocation and investment strategies.

I took out the API keys but everything else is up there so you can see how it works.
